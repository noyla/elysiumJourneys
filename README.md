# ZKsync Hardhat project template

This project was scaffolded with [zksync-cli](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-cli).

## Project Layout

- `/contracts`: Contains solidity smart contracts.
- `/deploy`: Scripts for contract deployment and interaction.
- `/test`: Test files.
- `hardhat.config.ts`: Configuration settings.

## How to Use

- `npm run compile`: Compiles contracts.
- `npm run deploy`: Deploys using script `/deploy/deploy.ts`.
- `npm run interact`: Interacts with the deployed contract using `/deploy/interact.ts`.
- `npm run test`: Tests the contracts.

Note: Both `npm run deploy` and `npm run interact` are set in the `package.json`. You can also run your files directly, for example: `npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts`

### Network Support

`hardhat.config.ts` comes with a list of networks to deploy and test contracts. Add more by adjusting the `networks` section in the `hardhat.config.ts`. You can also override the default using the `--network` option, like: `hardhat test --network dockerizedNode`.

### Local Tests

Running `npm run test` by default runs the [ZKsync In-memory Node](https://docs.zksync.io/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node) provided by the [@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-node](https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/hardhat/hardhat-zksync-node) tool.

Important: ZKsync In-memory Node currently supports only the L2 node. If contracts also need L1, use another testing environment like Dockerized Node. Refer to [test documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/build/test-and-debug) for details.
